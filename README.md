**Description about my Project :** 

Weather-Project application that fetches and displays real-time weather data for the user's location. 
It leverages the OpenWeather API for current weather and hourly forecasts, while using the OpenMeteo API for weekly weather data. The app also integrates local caching to provide offline access to previously fetched weather information. 
The main functionalities include fetching weather based on the userâ€™s GPS location, displaying real-time weather data, and gracefully handling cases where location services or internet connectivity are unavailable.
